# Atari disk drive emulator
"The Seeeduino Xiao board, in collaboration with the CH376S board, operates in unison to emulate a disk drive compatible with Atari 8-bit computers dating from the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. The system is capable of both reading from and writing to USB memory devices, such as thumb drives, providing seamless compatibility with modern storage solutions."
# About
"This project, which I started a few years ago, was initially a means for me to learn programming in the C language, particularly for use in embedded environments. The inspiration behind the project was to facilitate communication between an Atari 8-bit computer and a USB memory device.

You might wonder, why an Atari 8-bit computer? Well, back in the 1980s, I owned an Atari 600XL computer that my parents bought from a school friend. It was my first real home computer, and I cherished it for its ability to be programmed in Basic and, of course, for the vast array of games it offered. However, I soon found that its original 16K of memory was insufficient, prompting me to have it internally upgraded to 64K. Seeing the 

As part of this project, I delved deep into the extensive documentation available for the hardware of Atari 8-bit computers, which is still accessible today."
