# Atari disk drive emulator
Seeeduino Xiao board + CH376S board work together to emulate a disk drive that is compatible with every Atari 8-bit computer from the 70's, 80's and early 90's.
It can read and write USB memory devices like thumbdrives, etc.
# About
"This project, which I started a few years ago, was initially a means for me to learn programming in the C language, particularly for use in embedded environments. The inspiration behind the project was to facilitate communication between an Atari 8-bit computer and a USB memory device.

You might wonder, why an Atari 8-bit computer? Well, back in the 1980s, I owned an Atari 600XL computer that my parents bought from a school friend. It was my first real home computer, and I cherished it for its ability to be programmed in Basic and, of course, for the vast array of games it offered. However, I soon found that its original 16K of memory was insufficient, prompting me to have it internally upgraded to 64K.

As part of this project, I delved deep into the extensive documentation available for the hardware of Atari 8-bit computers, which is still accessible today."
