# Atari disk drive emulator
"The Seeeduino Xiao board, in collaboration with the CH376S board, operates in unison to emulate a disk drive compatible with Atari 8-bit computers dating from the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. The system is capable of both reading from and writing to USB memory devices, such as thumb drives, providing seamless compatibility with modern storage solutions."
# About
"This project, which I started a few years ago, was initially a means for me to learn programming in the C language, particularly for use in embedded environments. The inspiration behind the project was to facilitate communication between an Atari 8-bit computer and a USB memory device.

You might wonder, why an Atari 8-bit computer? Well, back in the 1980s, I owned an Atari 600XL computer that my parents bought from a school friend. It was my first real home computer, and I cherished it for its ability to be programmed in Basic and, of course, for the vast array of games it offered. However, I soon found that its original 16K of memory was insufficient, prompting me to have it internally upgraded to 64K.

Watching the upgrade process of the Atari 600XL up-close, from its original 16K of memory to an expanded 64K, sparked my interest in electronics. In an era before the widespread availability of the World Wide Web, I turned to books to learn more about the subject.

Back in the day, I mainly stuck to Basic when programming on the Atari 600XL since there weren't many other options. But the real magic was in assembly language – it was lightning-fast, and nearly all the games and programs were built with it. If you wanted to pull off anything really exciting on an Atari 600XL or any 8-bit computer from that era, assembly language was the way to go. However, coding in assembly could be a bit of a grind because it lacked the structured approach that Basic provided, even if just a bit. Plus, programming in assembly language was very unforgiving. The language didn't provide warnings while coding, and making mistakes could be quite challenging, at least in the era of the Atari 600XL. Basic, on the other hand, provided some safety net.

In the mid-1990s, long after the Atari 600XL had been replaced by a Personal Computer, I became intrigued by the programming language C. However, at the time, it seemed like a mystical art to me – I just couldn't wrap my head around it. So, I turned to Pascal instead. While it was supposedly less challenging, it still felt pretty daunting. Ultimately, my programming endeavors fizzled out, and from the late 1990s until 2020, I took a break from programming altogether.

Then came COVID-19. In late 2020 and early 2021, I decided to buy a secondhand Atari 600XL out of nostalgia and as a way to keep busy during the extended periods at home due to the restrictions. The Atari 600XL was in its original state, so it only had 16K of memory. I upgraded it to 64K myself with the help of useful information I found online. The 64K memory chip I purchased from a large Chinese company, as it was the only source I could find.

As part of this project, I delved deep into the extensive documentation available for the hardware of Atari 8-bit computers, which is still accessible today."
