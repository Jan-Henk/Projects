# Atari disk drive emulator
The Seeeduino Xiao board, combined with the CH376S board, works together to emulate a disk drive that Atari 8-bit computers from the home computer era can recognize. This setup allows the system to read & write data from & to USB memory devices like thumb drives, making it easy to use modern storage options with older Atari computers.
